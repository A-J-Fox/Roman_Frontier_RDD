# Roman Frontier Project

Welcome! This repository holds the code for my project studying the impact of the ancient Roman border on modern economic development in Hungary. This was a term project for an MA econometrics course. I use a spatial regression discontinuity design to estimate the impact of the Roman frontier, using luminosity data from the NOAA as a proxy for economic development. 

The Roman border through modern Hungary (the Limes Pannonicus) followed the Danube river, and was the site of a major military road. Most cities in Western Hungary were also founded by the Romans. I argue that despite the upheaval and population movements of late antiquity and the Magyar invasion, the infrastructure left in  transdanubia gave the people on the western bank a head start, so to speak. 


Details on the historical background to this project can be found in the "Hungary_Paper.pdf"

The files are as follows: 

Hungary_paper.pdf - the actual paper, background, analysis, regression tables

Roman_Border_RDD.pdf - a pdf of the R markdown file with code and plots, many not displayed in the paper

Roman_Border_RDD.Rmd - the raw R markdown file

Metrics-Project.r - the even more raw code with my original comments
